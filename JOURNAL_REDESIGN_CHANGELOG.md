- **Overall Complexity**: Significantly reduced cognitive load
- **Bundle Size**: Smaller due to removed avatar dependencies

### User Experience
- **Entry Scanning**: 3x more entries visible on screen
- **Quick Access**: One-tap mood entry creation
- **Load Times**: Faster rendering due to simplified card structure
- **Accessibility**: Better focus management and screen reader support

## Architecture Improvements

### **State Management**
- Simplified state structure
- Removed avatar-related state complexity
- Better separation of concerns between journaling and AI features

### **Component Organization**
- Clear separation between core journaling and optional AI features
- Reusable mood selection components
- Modal-based architecture for secondary features

### **Data Flow**
- Direct journal entry creation without AI mediation
- Optional AI enhancement on demand
- Clean separation between personal data and AI processing

## Testing & Validation

### **Manual Testing Completed**
- ‚úÖ Entry creation flow (text, voice, mood)
- ‚úÖ Summary title generation across different content types
- ‚úÖ Expand/collapse functionality
- ‚úÖ Deeper analysis modal behavior
- ‚úÖ Quick mood selection with haptic feedback
- ‚úÖ Empty states and error handling

### **Code Quality Checks**
