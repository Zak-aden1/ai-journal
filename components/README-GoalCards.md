This system transforms static goal displays into dynamic, personality-driven experiences that adapt based on user patterns and avatar characteristics.

## Features

- **Compact Layout**: Efficient list view for quick goal management (inspired by Image 2)
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Seamless switching between view modes

### 🧠 **Memory & Pattern Recognition**
- **Best Time Recognition**: Avatars recognize and celebrate when users are in their optimal time zones
