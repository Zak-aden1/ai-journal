# Home Page Redesign & Core Features

## Current Home Page Issues

### Design Problems
1. **Conflicting Data Sources**: Dummy data carousel vs "Your Real Data" section creates confusion
2. **Poor Information Hierarchy**: Too many competing sections (carousel, Today's Focus, Real Data)
3. **Disconnected Experience**: Beautiful avatars don't relate to actual user progress
4. **Overwhelming Layout**: Multiple carousels, cards, and sections feel cluttered
5. **Unclear Primary Action**: What should users focus on daily?

### Core User Journey Disconnect
- Home screen shows dummy data while real data sits in a separate section
- Users can't actually *use* the app for its core purpose - daily habit tracking
- No connection between beautiful UI and functional habit completion
- Hold-to-complete interaction doesn't work with real habits

## Redesigned Home Page Vision

### New Approach: Single Unified Experience
**Core Principle**: One cohesive view that shows real goals, real habits, and real progress with beautiful avatars that actually respond to user behavior.

### Proposed Layout
```
Home Screen Redesign:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Header (greeting + daily progress summary)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Primary Goal Card (main focus with avatar)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Goal avatar (real vitality from real habits)  
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Today's habits for this goal
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Quick completion interactions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Secondary Goals (compact cards, swipeable)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Standalone Habits (if any)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Quick Actions (+ add habit, view all)
```

### Key Design Changes

1. **One Goal, One Avatar Focus**: 
   - Feature primary goal prominently with its avatar
   - Avatar shows real vitality based on actual habit completions
   - Secondary goals in compact, swipeable cards below

2. **Integrated Habit Completion**:
   - Today's habits directly in goal cards
   - Real hold-to-complete interactions
   - Immediate avatar reactions to completions

3. **Simplified Information Architecture**:
   - Remove dummy data carousel
   - Remove separate "Your Real Data" section  
   - Everything is real data, beautifully presented

4. **Clear Daily Flow**:
   - "What should I do today?" is immediately obvious
   - Progress is visible and motivating
   - Next actions are clear

### Specific UI Improvements

**Header Redesign**:
- Personalized daily greeting with actual progress
- "2 of 5 habits completed today" instead of generic message

**Goal Cards**:
- Primary goal: Large card with avatar, progress, today's habits
- Secondary goals: Compact horizontal scrollable cards
- Real completion states, real streaks, real progress

**Avatar Integration**:
- Avatars show actual vitality from real habit completions
- Contextual messages based on real progress patterns
- Visual state changes when habits are completed

**Interaction Design**:
- Hold-to-complete works on real habits
- Immediate feedback and avatar reactions
- Micro-celebrations for completions

## Primary Goal Selection Strategy

### Problem: Multiple Goals Priority
When users have multiple goals, which one should be featured prominently on the home screen?

### Recommended Approach: Smart Default + User Control

#### Implementation Strategy
1. **Smart Default**: Algorithm picks best goal automatically
2. **User Override**: Tap goal header to "Set as primary focus"
3. **Dynamic Fallback**: If user hasn't chosen, algorithm decides daily

#### Primary Goal Selection Algorithm
```typescript
function selectPrimaryGoal(goals, habits, userPreference) {
  // 1. User explicit choice (if set)
  if (userPreference) return userPreference;
  
  // 2. Goal with most pending habits today
  const goalByPendingHabits = getMostPendingHabitsToday(goals);
  if (goalByPendingHabits) return goalByPendingHabits;
  
  // 3. Most recently interacted goal
  const recentGoal = getMostRecentlyActiveGoal(goals);
  if (recentGoal) return recentGoal;
  
  // 4. First created goal (fallback)
  return goals[0];
}
```

#### Algorithm Priority
1. **Goal with most pending habits today** (most actionable)
2. **Goal with highest completion rate this week** (momentum)
3. **Most recently created goal** (newest intention)
4. **First goal** (fallback)

#### UI Implementation
- Small "‚≠ê Primary Focus" badge on the main goal card
- Other goals show as "üìã [Goal Name]" in compact cards
- Tap any goal card to "Set as primary focus"

#### Benefits
- **No setup required**: Works immediately for new users
- **User control**: Can override when they want focus
- **Adapts daily**: Highlights most relevant goal each day
- **Simple UX**: One main goal, others accessible but secondary
